# Simple ShareX Image Host
 
 ## Installation

 Change `secret_key` in both upload.php and delete.php to a secure key of some sort
 Change `domain_url` in upload.php to your domain
 Change all instances of https://example.com/ to your own domain

 upload the files to your server and create the folder `img_host` and make sure your web server software has read and write access to it

 Setup ShareX or what ever image upload to you are using to use the correct paths
I have provided an example ShareX config

 Profit!
